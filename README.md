# About @helenprojects
- 👋 I'm a geek with a wide experience base, currently working as a technical writer specialising in developer docs and complex system integration (devices, enterprise apps) documentation.
  - My first attempt at open source code contribution was sending a patch into the Elm maintainers in 1990 to fix Elm's encryption of saved emails. It was rejected, leaving the bug in place in the official distribution. Several dozen orgs who heard about it through the grapevine continued to apply my unofficial patch to subsequent releases because it was a legit bug in Elm and my patch did fix it.
- 👀 Tech-wise, I’m interested in documentaiton tools, XML, cybersecurity, DevOps, network protocols, file systems, C, and C#. I'm a UNIX native who often works on Windows and can even hold my own on z/OS mainframes.
  - E.g., I wrote an XSLT that translates from DocBook XML to Confluence XML; I tried but could not get my employer to let me open source it.
  - I'm that person who gets asked, "Hey, can you see what's wrong with this xpath expr?" by devs, support techs, and other writers wherever I work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go and how to structure yaml files intelligently, and trying to keep up with advances in distributed system architecture.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on documentation tools (feature feedback, testing, coding if it's not java ;-), and on creating REST API documentation for open source apps.
- 📫 How to reach me. TBD.
